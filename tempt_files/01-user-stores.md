**why analysis of polyclinic data is necessary** for Singapore’s healthcare system.

## Strategic & Policy Planning

1. **As an MOH policymaker**, I want to understand long-term trends in polyclinic attendances and disease burden so that I can plan national healthcare capacity and funding sustainably.

2. **As a Healthier SG programme lead**, I want to identify which chronic conditions are most frequently managed at polyclinics so that preventive and community-based interventions can be prioritised.

3. **As a public health strategist**, I want to detect emerging shifts in disease patterns early so that policies can be adjusted before hospital demand escalates.

## Resource Allocation & Operations

4. **As a regional health system planner**, I want to compare utilisation patterns across polyclinics so that manpower, operating hours, and services can be allocated more equitably.

5. **As an MOH operations director**, I want to analyse peak demand periods and patient load so that appointment systems and staffing models can be optimised.

6. **As a finance planner**, I want to understand cost drivers in primary care usage so that subsidies and funding models remain fiscally sustainable.

---

## Population Health & Equity

7. **As a population health analyst**, I want to analyse attendance and condition data by demographic groups so that vulnerable populations can be better targeted with interventions.

8. **As a health equity policymaker**, I want to identify geographic or socioeconomic disparities in polyclinic usage so that access gaps can be addressed.

9. **As a preventive care lead**, I want to understand repeat visit patterns for preventable conditions so that upstream interventions can reduce avoidable utilisation.

---

## Quality of Care & Outcomes

10. **As a clinical governance lead**, I want to analyse condition-specific trends and outcomes so that clinical guidelines and care pathways can be reviewed.

11. **As a primary care quality manager**, I want to identify variation in treatment patterns across polyclinics so that best practices can be standardised.

---

## System Integration & Future Readiness

12. **As an MOH digital health planner**, I want to understand how polyclinic data integrates with hospital and NEHR data so that care continuity and data sharing can be improved.

13. **As a healthcare transformation lead**, I want to assess how polyclinic utilisation changes after major policy shifts (e.g. Healthier SG enrolment) so that programme effectiveness can be evaluated.

14. **As a crisis preparedness planner**, I want to analyse historical demand surges (e.g. flu seasons, pandemics) so that the system is better prepared for future public health shocks.

---

## Public Accountability & Communication

15. **As an MOH communications lead**, I want to translate polyclinic data into clear insights so that the public understands healthcare trends and policy rationale.

16. **As a government decision-maker**, I want evidence-based insights from polyclinic data so that policy decisions can be defended transparently and confidently.
