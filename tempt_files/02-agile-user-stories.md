Perfect — below is a **refined Agile-style set of user stories** tailored for **MOH / Singapore public healthcare**, with **clear acceptance criteria** that explicitly justify *why* analysis is needed and *what decisions it enables*. I’ve kept them concise, outcome-driven, and realistic for government analytics work.

---

## Epic 1: National Healthcare Planning & Policy

### US-1: Disease Burden Trend Analysis

**As an** MOH policymaker
**I want** to analyse long-term trends in polyclinic attendances by condition
**So that** national healthcare capacity and funding can be planned sustainably

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Trends are available by condition and year
* Significant increases or decreases are statistically identified
* Insights clearly indicate policy implications (e.g. shift from acute to chronic care)

---

### US-2: Policy Impact Evaluation

**As an** MOH policy analyst
**I want** to compare polyclinic utilisation before and after major policy changes
**So that** the effectiveness of healthcare reforms (e.g. Healthier SG) can be evaluated

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Pre- and post-policy periods are clearly defined
* Changes in utilisation are quantified and contextualised
* Confounding factors are highlighted where relevant

---

## Epic 2: Resource Allocation & Operations Optimisation

### US-3: Polyclinic Demand Forecasting

**As an** operations planner
**I want** to forecast future polyclinic demand using historical attendance data
**So that** staffing, appointment slots, and infrastructure can be optimised

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Forecasts are produced at national and cluster levels
* Seasonal and cyclical patterns are captured
* Forecast uncertainty is communicated clearly

---

### US-4: Inter-Polyclinic Utilisation Comparison

**As a** regional health system manager
**I want** to compare utilisation rates across polyclinics
**So that** resources can be allocated equitably and efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Utilisation metrics are standardised
* Outliers are identified with explanatory context
* Insights support actionable resource reallocation

---

## Epic 3: Population Health & Health Equity

### US-5: Demographic Utilisation Analysis

**As a** population health analyst
**I want** to analyse polyclinic usage by age, gender, and other demographics
**So that** targeted interventions can be designed for high-need groups

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Demographic breakdowns are statistically robust
* High-utilisation or high-risk groups are clearly identified
* Findings link to possible preventive strategies

---

### US-6: Geographic Equity Assessment

**As an** MOH equity lead
**I want** to assess geographic variation in polyclinic attendance and conditions
**So that** access disparities can be addressed through policy or service redesign

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Geographic comparisons are normalised for population size
* Persistent disparities are highlighted
* Policy-relevant explanations are provided

---

## Epic 4: Preventive Care & Demand Reduction

### US-7: Preventable Condition Monitoring

**As a** preventive care strategist
**I want** to identify high-volume preventable conditions seen at polyclinics
**So that** upstream interventions can reduce avoidable healthcare demand

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Preventable conditions are clearly defined
* Repeat visit rates are analysed
* Insights support preventive programme prioritisation

---

### US-8: Frequent Attender Analysis

**As a** primary care planner
**I want** to identify patterns among frequent polyclinic users
**So that** care models can be redesigned to manage demand more effectively

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Frequent attenders are consistently defined
* Drivers of repeat visits are explored
* Recommendations align with care integration strategies

---

## Epic 5: Quality of Care & System Performance

### US-9: Clinical Variation Analysis

**As a** clinical governance lead
**I want** to analyse variation in condition management across polyclinics
**So that** best practices can be standardised and care quality improved

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Variation is quantified and benchmarked
* Clinically meaningful differences are identified
* Findings are suitable for guideline review discussions

---

### US-10: Outcome Proxy Monitoring

**As an** MOH quality analyst
**I want** to monitor outcome proxies (e.g. repeat visits, referrals)
**So that** quality of primary care can be assessed indirectly

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Outcome proxies are clearly justified
* Trends and anomalies are highlighted
* Limitations are transparently stated

---

## Epic 6: System Resilience & Preparedness

### US-11: Demand Surge Analysis

**As a** public health preparedness planner
**I want** to analyse historical demand surges at polyclinics
**So that** future outbreaks and crises can be managed proactively

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Surge periods are clearly identified
* Response effectiveness is assessed
* Lessons learned are summarised for planning use

---

## Epic 7: Transparency & Decision Support

### US-12: Executive-Ready Insights

**As a** senior decision-maker
**I want** concise, evidence-based insights derived from polyclinic data
**So that** decisions can be made confidently and communicated transparently

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Insights are decision-oriented, not descriptive
* Visuals and narratives are clear and minimal
* Policy implications are explicitly stated

---

### Why this works for MOH / Singapore

* Stories are **decision-centric**, not analytics-centric
* Acceptance criteria enforce **policy usefulness**
* Aligns with **public accountability, sustainability, and prevention**

If you want next:

* Convert this into a **product backlog**
* Map each story to **specific KPIs & datasets**
* Tailor it for a **MOH job interview, white paper, or analytics roadmap**
