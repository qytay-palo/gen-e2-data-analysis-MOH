# Generate User Stories from Problem Statements

## Role
You are a **senior data analyst** with expertise in:
- Translating analytical objectives into actionable user stories
- Breaking down complex data initiatives into iterative, deliverable increments
- Balancing technical feasibility with business value
- Designing analytics workflows that follow best practices in data analytics

## Objective
Decompose **ALL problem statements into high-quality, manageable user stories** for data science and analytics work. You must process every problem statement found in `docs/objectives/problem_statements/` directory. Analyze the problem statements and generate a list of user stories for each problem statement. The stories should represent distinct pieces of functionality or value from an end-user perspective.

These user stories will:
- Drive an automated analytics planning system
- Guide sprint planning and execution
- Enable incremental value delivery to stakeholders
- Form the basis for technical implementation

**CRITICAL**: This task must be completed for ALL problem statements in the project, not just a subset. Generate comprehensive user stories for every problem statement file you find.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Project Context

#### Inputs
You have access to the following project documentation files:
   - **Read ALL files** from `docs/objectives/problem_statements/` directory to understand:
      - Each problem statement's scope, objectives, and expected outcomes
      - Stakeholders and their needs
      - Business priorities and success criteria
   - Review `docs/project_context/` folder for additional context on:
     - Available data sources and their characteristics
     - Technical stack and platform constraints
     - Other project background that may influence story design
   - Review `docs/data_dictionary/` for data field definitions and structures

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: All problem statements must be **grounded in available data sources** documented in [docs/project_context/data_sources.md](../../../docs/project_context/data_sources.md) and **feasible with the current tech stack** documented in [docs/project_context/tech_stack.md](../../../docs/project_context/tech_stack.md). Do not propose problems that require unavailable data or exceed technical capabilities.

#### Expected Problem Statement Format

Each problem statement file in `docs/objectives/problem_statements/` should contain:
- **Problem Statement Title and ID**: Clear, descriptive name with unique identifier
- **Business Objective**: What business problem this problem statement solves
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes that define completion
- **Stakeholders**: Who benefits and who needs to be involved
- **Scope**: What is included and explicitly excluded
- **Assumptions and Constraints**: Technical, data, or resource limitations

**If problem statements are incomplete or poorly defined**: Make reasonable assumptions based on project context and document them in the generated user stories.

### Step 2: Extract Stakeholders and Gather Domain Knowledge

This step ensures that domain expertise is captured and made available to guide feature engineering and analysis decisions throughout the project.

#### a. Identify Stakeholders

For each problem statement:
- Extract all stakeholder types mentioned (e.g., healthcare operations manager, policy analyst, clinician)
- Document their roles, expertise areas, and analytical perspectives
- Group stakeholders by domain (e.g., healthcare operations, policy, clinical practice, public health)
- Note specific expertise or concerns each stakeholder brings

#### b. Assess Domain Knowledge Requirements

For each stakeholder group and problem statement, identify relevant domain knowledge areas needed for:
- Understanding context, terminology, and domain-specific concepts
- Feature engineering and variable selection
- Interpreting analytical results and validating assumptions
- Identifying relevant metrics, KPIs, and benchmarks
- Recognizing data quality issues specific to the domain

#### c. Check Existing Domain Knowledge Files

Search the `/docs` directory structure for existing domain knowledge documentation:

- Search for files matching patterns:
  - `stakeholder-{role}-expertise.md`
  - `{domain}-terminology-glossary.md`
  - `{domain}-metrics-kpis.md`
  - `{domain}-feature-engineering-guide.md`
  - `{analytical-area}-best-practices.md`
- Review existing files for:
  - Completeness relative to problem statement needs
  - Currency of information (check last updated date)
  - Coverage of relevant metrics and features

#### d. Update or Create Domain Knowledge Files

**If relevant files exist:**
- Review content against current problem statement requirements

#### g. Integration with User Story Generation

The domain knowledge gathered in this step should inform:
- **Feature engineering tasks** in user stories (reference specific features from domain knowledge)
- **Acceptance criteria** (use standard metrics and KPIs documented)
- **Technical constraints** (apply domain-specific data quality considerations)
- **Implementation tasks** (leverage documented analytical methodologies)
- **Validation approaches** (use domain-appropriate benchmarks and ranges)

When generating user stories in subsequent steps, explicitly reference relevant domain knowledge files to guide implementation.

---

### Step 3: Identify User Stories from Each Problem Statement

Breakdown each problem statement into distinct user stories according to the following guidelines:

#### a. Apply INVEST Principles

Ensure each story adheres to the INVEST principles:

1.  **Independent:** Stories should be self-contained and ideally implementable without depending on others in the same batch (though natural dependencies between features are okay). Avoid tightly coupling unrelated concepts in one story.
2.  **Negotiable:** Stories are not contracts. They represent the essence of the requirement, leaving room for discussion and refinement of details during backlog grooming or sprint planning.
3.  **Valuable:** Each story must deliver tangible value to a specific end-user, stakeholder, or the system itself (e.g., improving performance, security). Clearly articulate the "so that" benefit.
4.  **Estimable:** The story should be clear and defined enough that the development team can reasonably estimate the effort required to implement it. Avoid vague or overly broad stories.
5.  **Small:** Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single iteration (e.g., a typical sprint). Break down large problem statements or features into smaller, manageable stories.
6.  **Testable:** Each story must have implicit or explicit acceptance criteria. It should be possible to verify that the story has been implemented correctly.

#### b. Use Vertical Slicing for Data Analysis Workflows (CRITICAL)

*   **DO:** Create stories that represent a complete, thin slice of analytical value from data extraction through to actionable insights. Each story should deliver tangible analytical outcomes that stakeholders can use.
*   **DO:** For complex analytical problems, break them down by **data analysis lifecycle stages**:
    1. **Data Extraction & Ingestion** - Getting raw data from sources
    2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - Preparing data for analysis
    3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding patterns and characteristics
    4. **Feature Engineering** - Creating analytical variables
    5. **Statistical Analysis/Modeling** - Applying analytical methods
    6. **Model Evaluation & Validation** - Assessing quality and reliability
    7. **Visualization & Reporting** - Communicating insights
*   **DO:** Example of proper lifecycle decomposition: Instead of one massive story "As an analyst, I want to forecast disease outbreaks," break it into:
    - Story 1: "As an analyst, I want to explore historical disease patterns so that I can understand baseline trends" (EDA stage)
    - Story 2: "As an analyst, I want to develop a baseline forecasting model so that I can establish prediction benchmarks" (Initial Modeling stage)
    - Story 3: "As an analyst, I want to create an interactive forecasting dashboard so that stakeholders can visualize predictions" (Visualization stage)
*   **DO NOT:** Split stories horizontally by technical layer. Avoid stories like: "Create the database table," "Build the API endpoint," or "Design the UI component." These are implementation tasks, not user stories.
*   **DO NOT:** Create stories that are just technical tasks without clear user value, such as "Clean the dataset" or "Run regression model." Instead, frame them with user value: "As an analyst, I want clean demographic data so that I can produce reliable trend analyses."

#### c. Data Analysis Lifecycle Decomposition Strategy

For analytical problem statements, systematically decompose them following the data analysis lifecycle. **Note:** The stages below are guidelines and commonly used patterns, but are **not limited to the following**. Adapt, combine, or add stages as needed based on the specific problem statement requirements and complexity.

**Stage 1: Data Extraction & Understanding**
- Stories focusing on acquiring, loading, and profiling raw data
- Outcome: Stakeholders understand what data is available and its characteristics
- Example: "As an analyst, I want to extract 5 years of disease surveillance data so that I can assess data completeness and quality"

**Stage 2: Data Preparation & Quality**
- Stories about cleaning, transforming, and validating data
- Outcome: Analysis-ready datasets with documented quality metrics
- Example: "As an analyst, I want to clean and standardize disease classification codes so that I can ensure consistent temporal comparisons"

**Stage 3: Exploratory Analysis**
- Stories for discovering patterns, distributions, and relationships
- Outcome: Initial insights and hypotheses documented for stakeholders
- Example: "As a public health analyst, I want to identify seasonal disease patterns so that I can formulate outbreak timing hypotheses"

**Stage 4: Feature Engineering**
- Stories creating analytical variables and derived metrics
- Outcome: Rich feature set ready for modeling or advanced analysis
- Example: "As an analyst, I want to engineer temporal features (lag variables, rolling averages) so that I can capture disease transmission dynamics"

**Stage 5: Advanced Analysis & Modeling**
- Stories applying statistical methods, forecasting, or machine learning
- Outcome: Validated analytical models or statistical findings
- Example: "As a policy analyst, I want to develop a seasonal forecasting model so that I can predict outbreak peaks 3 months in advance"

**Stage 6: Validation & Evaluation**
- Stories assessing model performance, conducting sensitivity analysis
- Outcome: Confidence metrics and model limitations documented
- Example: "As an analyst, I want to evaluate forecast accuracy across different disease types so that I can communicate prediction reliability"

**Stage 7: Visualization & Insight Communication**
- Stories creating dashboards, reports, and interactive tools
- Outcome: Actionable insights accessible to decision-makers
- Example: "As a healthcare operations manager, I want an interactive outbreak dashboard so that I can monitor predictions and allocate resources proactively"

#### d. Story Format Requirements

*   Assign a sequential number to each story title that reflects the lifecycle stage (e.g., `# User Story: 1 - Exploratory Disease Pattern Analysis`, `# User Story: 2 - Baseline Forecasting Model Development`).
*   Focus on extracting user-centric requirements and value propositions discussed.
*   Ignore conversational filler, off-topic discussions, or administrative details unless they directly inform a requirement.
*   If the problem statement mentions specific user roles, use them. Otherwise, infer logical user types (e.g., "user," "administrator," "analyst").
*   If acceptance criteria are explicitly discussed, include them as bullet points under the relevant story.
*   Ensure story titles clearly indicate which lifecycle stage they address.

### Step 4: Generate User Story Files

#### a. File Organization

1. Story files should be placed in:
   `docs/objectives/user_stories/problem-statement-{num}-{name}/<numerical_prefix>-<story_name>.md`

2. Each problem statement should have an index.md, should be updated when any story is updated, created or deleted:
   `docs/objectives/user_stories/problem-statement-{num}-{name}/index.md`

   - Lists all stories in the feature
   - Brief description of each story
   - Links to story files
   - List of reusable components in the feature

3. Main problem statements index should be updated:
   `docs/objectives/problem_statements/index.md`

   - Add new problem statement if needed
   - Link to problem statement index
   - Brief problem statement description
   - Key stories or functionality
   - List of reusable components
   - Overall problem statement progress tracking

#### b. File Naming Convention

Use a two-digit sequential number prefix followed by kebab-case based on the story's core goal:
- `01-analyze-visit-patterns-by-age.md`
- `02-identify-seasonal-utilization-trends.md`

#### c. File Content Structure

Each markdown file should contain *one* user story following this format:

```markdown
# User Story: [Story Number] - [Brief Title Describing the Goal]

*   [Domain-specific considerations for this story]

## 4. 📦 Dependencies

*   [External packages with purpose]
*   [Internal dependencies and models]

## 5. ✅ Implementation Tasks

Each task has a status indicator:
- ⬜ Not Started
- 🟨 In Progress
- ✅ Completed

Common task groups:
- **Data Extraction**: Source identification, data loading, API integration
